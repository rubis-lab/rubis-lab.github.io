      	<font size="15">R</font>ubis means Real-time Ubiquitous System Lab. The convergence of computing, communication, and sensing technologies allows us to build a ubiquitous computing environment where we can enjoy various information services wherever we go and whenever we want.<br>
      	As this technology convergence continues, it will become possible that computers integrated with sensing and communication can interact with humans and environments in fine-granular real-time.<br>
      	With such fine-granular real-time interactions, computer systems can provide intelligent and proactive services such as real-time monitoring and assistance for the elderly, detecting and tracking kidnappers, and rescuing survivors in natural disasters, which makes our daily lives more secure and enjoyable.<br>
      	To realize such real-time ubiquitous systems, we are conducting theoretical and practical researches including temporal behavior analysis of interconnected heterogeneous resources, real-time packet delivery in wireless sensor networks, indoor/outdoor real-time tracking of humans and their belongings, and network performance measurements for QoS provisioning.<br><br>
